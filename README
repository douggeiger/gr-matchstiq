This directory contains the implementation of gr-matchstiq block, for
use of GNU radio with Epiq Solutions' Matchstiq hardware 
(http://epiqsolutions.com/matchstiq)

What's New (from 06/21/2013 beta version):
  * Work function has timeout on blocking calls
  * Improved handling and parsing of configuration data
  * Updated source block name to reflect output type 
       (matchstiq_source_c is now matchstiq_source_s)
  * Adherence to GNU radio coding style
  * Improved error handling and stability

Know Limitations:
  * Supports only continuous mode operation
  * Tested only under GNU radio v3.6.4

  1) Create a build directory
      > mkdir build
  2) Change to the build directory
      > cd build
  3) Run cmake

          run with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)
      > cmake ../
           OR
      > cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my_install_directory ../
  4) Build the code
